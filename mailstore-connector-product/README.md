# Mailstore Connector

Unlock the potential of Axon Ivy's Mailstore connector to streamline your process automation endeavors, simplifying email management within your business processes. This versatile connector:

- Seamlessly integrates with both IMAP and POP3 mail stores.
- Ensures data security through robust SSL encryption.
- Accelerates your integration efforts with a user-friendly, ready-to-copy demo implementation. onuploadpayday

Please be aware that the comprehensive feature set is exclusively accessible through the IMAP email protocol, while POP3 provides only fundamental functionality.

## Demo

Two demo processes are provided:

- One implemented as an **Ivy sub-process**
- One implemented as a **Java service function**

> Both perform the same task – choose whichever integration style fits your needs.

Both demos connect to an **IMAP inbox**.

For testing purposes, you can use:

- A Docker container such as [`virtua-sa/docker-mail-devel`](https://github.com/virtua-sa/docker-mail-devel)
- A public IMAP testing service like [Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/)
- Any IMAP-capable client such as [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/de/)

The demo reads messages from the standard inbox that contain the text: `Test 999` (where `999` is any number).

For each matching message, it:

- Saves the message as a **case document**
- Extracts all **image parts**
- Logs relevant metadata to the **Ivy log**

> To test it, prepare such messages in the inbox.  
> Messages are **not deleted or moved**, to keep testing repeatable and safe.

### 📝 Output & Outlook

- All output is written to the **Ivy log**.
- A simple GUI might be added in a future version — stay tuned!


## Usage

### From Java or Ivy Script

1. Use `com.axonivy.connector.mailstore.MailStoreService.messageIterator(String, String, String, boolean, Predicate<Message>, Comparator<Message>)` to obtain an iterator over new emails in a specific folder of a mail store. You can then iterate through these messages based on the provided filter and configuration flags.
  - If a **destination folder** is specified, messages that are successfully handled will be **moved** there.
  - If the **delete flag** is set, successfully handled messages will be **deleted** from the source folder instead.


2. A filter can be defined to match only specific messages. Standard filters are provided to match parts of the **subject**, **sender**, **recipients**, and more.  
  - Filters are based on the standard Java `Predicate<Message>` interface and can be easily defined and combined using standard Java functionality such as `Predicate.and(...)` or `Predicate.or(...)`.


3. Similar to filter, the sort follows the standard Java `Comparator<Message>` interface and can sort sent date, received date, subject,...

4. A typical call that reads emails with a specific subject like `Request 12345` from the `inbox` folder and moves them to an `archive` folder after successful processing can be written as follows:


```java
MessageIteraor it = MailsStoreService.messageIterator("etherealImaps", "INBOX", "archive", true, MailStoreService.subjectMatches(".*Request [0-9]+.*"), new MessageComparator())
```

When you have successfully handled an email, you should call the `handledMessage(boolean)` function.  
This informs the iterator to perform the configured action (e.g., move or delete) for that message.

If you do **not** call this function, or if you call it with `false`, the message will remain in the store and will be delivered again during the next run.


### As a sub-process

All Email-handling can also be performed calling the provided sub-process `MailStoreConnector.handleMessages` and overriding the process to handle a single email `MessageHandler.handleMessage`. Handling of emails will be marked as successful, when the overridden process returns with `handled=true` (and does not throw an error).

### Message handling

Handling a single message is easily supported by the `com.axonivy.connector.mailstore.MessageService.getAllParts(Message, boolean, Predicate<Part>)` and other convenience functions. The funtions support old style mails with text only and also MIME mails which can contain many different parts and even email-attachments. The basic idea is to pass a message and a filter to this function and then get back a list of `parts` matching the filter. Again, filters follow the standard Java `Predicate<Message>` interface and can be easily defined and combined with existing Java functionality (like `Predicate.and` or `Predicate.or`).

A typical call, extracting all images from an Email would look like this:

```java
Collection<Part> images = MessageService.getAllParts(message, false, MessageService.isImage("*"));
```

Additional convenience functions are provided to

* load and save messages
* extract all texts
* read binary content of a part

## Setup

Configure one or more mailstores in global variables. A mailstore is identified by a name and a
global variable section containing access information. The following example shows connection information
for a mailstore that should be accessible under the name `etherealImaps`. Put this variable block into your
project. At least `protocol`, `host`, `user` and `password` must be defined (note the encrypted `password`
and the value list for `protocol` which will later provide some input support in the engine cockpit).

If you want to see connection logs, enable the `debug` switch.  
If your connection requires special settings, you can define them in the `properties` section.


```yaml
Variables:
  mailstoreConnector:
    etherealImaps:
      # [enum: pop3, pop3s, imap, imaps]
      protocol: 'imaps'
      # Host for store connection
      host: 'imap.ethereal.email'
      # Port for store connection (only needed if not default)
      port: -1
      # User name for store connection
      user: 'myname@ethereal.email'
      # Password for store connection
      # [password]
      password: '${encrypt:mypassword}'
      # show debug output for connection
      debug: true
      # Additional properties for store connection,
      # see https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/imap/package-summary.html
      properties:
          # mail.imaps.ssl.checkserveridentity: false
          # mail.imaps.ssl.trust: '*'
```

OAuth 2.0 Support: Azure client_credential/password grant flow

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to configure OAuth 2.0 support using the Azure client credentials grant flow.

### Configuration Steps
1. Ensure that the necessary properties are enabled for JavaMail to support OAuth 2.0. For more details, refer to the [JavaMail API documentation](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/imap/package-summary.html#:~:text=or%20confidentiality%20layer.-,OAuth%202.0%20Support,-Support%20for%20OAuth).

```yaml
      properties:
          # only set below credential when you go with oauth2
          mail.imaps.auth.mechanisms: 'XOAUTH2'
          mail.imaps.sasl.enable: 'true'
          mail.imaps.sasl.mechanisms: 'XOAUTH2'
```

2. Add Credentials for Azure Authentication
Include your Azure credentials in the authentication configuration.
```yaml
      # Basic: username and password, AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider: currently only support OAuth2 client credentials grant flow
      # com.axonivy.connector.oauth.BasicUserPasswordProvider for Basic Authentication
      # com.axonivy.connector.oauth.AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider for AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider
      userPasswordProvider: 'com.axonivy.connector.oauth.AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider'
      
      # only set below credential when you go with oauth2
      # tenant to use for OAUTH2 request.
      # set the Azure Directory (tenant) ID, for application requests.
      tenantId: ''
      # Your Azure Application (client) ID, used for OAuth2 authentication
      appId: ''
      # Secret key from your applications "certificates & secrets" (client secret)
      secretKey: ''
      # for client_credentials: https://outlook.office365.com/.default
      scope: ''
      #[client_credentials]
      grantType: '
```

3. Provide a Complete YAML Configuration File
Ensure that a fully configured YAML file is available for the application.
```yaml
Variables:
  mailstoreConnector:
    localhostImapAzureOauth2Authentication:
      # [enum: pop3, pop3s, imap, imaps]
      protocol: 'imap'
      # Host for store connection
      host: 'localhost'
      # Port for store connection (only needed if not default)
      port: -1
      # User name for store connection
      user: 'debug@localdomain.test'
      # Password for store connection
      # [password]
      password: ''
      # show debug output for connection
      debug: true
      # Additional properties for store connection,
      # see https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/imap/package-summary.html
      properties:
          mail.imaps.ssl.checkserveridentity: false
          mail.imaps.ssl.trust: '*'
          # only set below credential when you go with oauth2
          mail.imaps.auth.mechanisms: 'XOAUTH2'
          mail.imaps.sasl.enable: 'true'
          mail.imaps.sasl.mechanisms: 'XOAUTH2'
      
      # Basic: username and password, AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider: currently only support OAuth2 client credentials grant flow
      # com.axonivy.connector.oauth.BasicUserPasswordProvider for Basic Authentication
      # com.axonivy.connector.oauth.AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider for AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider
      userPasswordProvider: 'com.axonivy.connector.oauth.AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider'
      
      # only set below credential when you go with oauth2
      # tenant to use for OAUTH2 request.
      # set the Azure Directory (tenant) ID, for application requests.
      tenantId: ''
      # Your Azure Application (client) ID, used for OAuth2 authentication
      appId: ''
      # Secret key from your applications "certificates & secrets" (client secret)
      secretKey: ''
      # for client_credentials: https://outlook.office365.com/.default
      scope: ''
      #[client_credentials/password]
      grantType: ''
  # login url microsoft zure
  azureOAuth:
    loginUrl: 'login.microsoftonline.com'
```
> [!NOTE]
> The variable path `mailstore-connector` is renamed to `mailstoreConnector` from 13.

4. Set Up the Authentication Provider
Before calling the mailstore connector, you need to provide an authentication provider.
```java
  Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.axonivy.connector.oauth.AzureOauth2UserPasswordProvider");
	UserPasswordProvider userPasswordProvider = (UserPasswordProvider) clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
  MailStoreService.registerUserPasswordProvider(storeName, userPasswordProvider);
```
